# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution
### The challenge

- The challenge consisted of making an nft preview card, 
based on the model provided by the FrontEnd Mentor website.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- In this challenge I learned a lot about basic HTML semantics (example: div, inheritance tags, etc)
- The css was also very interesting, where I was able to use the pseudo-element hover to perform actions.
- Another thing that I was able to perfect was the work with grid and flexbox in this challenge, which after that I already felt a lot of difference in my perception.
