# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution
###The challenge

- The challenge consisted of making an nft preview card, 
based on the model provided by the FrontEnd Mentor website.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Through this challenge, it was possible to improve the visualization of the project (eg: imagine what to do, before d oing it).
- It was possible to train basic HTML (eg title hierarchy, div, class and id).
- In the CSS it was possible to train more measures, justify-content, among other basic tags, but that leave your site with a different appearance.
